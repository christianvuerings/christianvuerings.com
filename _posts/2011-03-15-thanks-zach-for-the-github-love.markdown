Ever since my first visit to [good-tutorials.com](http://good-tutorials.com) I've been following up on what [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) has been doing. He gained attention with [facelette](http://facelette.com/), and I just love his down to earth blogposts.

A few days ago I was watching [his screencast](http://zachholman.com/2011/01/automating-inefficiencies/) about automating inefficiencies and was intrigued by his desktop background. I did a quick search but couldn't find the GitHub logo in any large sizes. So I decided to tweet him:

A couple of hours later I got [his wallpaper](http://f.cl.ly/items/0k0q2I433M1u0M292S24/octowhite.png).

Too be honest I considered it a long shot, but it just shows what a nice guy he is and the kind of power Twitter has.

If you would like to use it yourself, I also made a [regular](http://cl.ly/0W3V280r0b2D2Q0z171F) and [inverted](http://cl.ly/1P18460E0d0Q2f2C3g1e) version of the GitHub logo in SVG.

Feel free to use it and spread the GitHub love!
