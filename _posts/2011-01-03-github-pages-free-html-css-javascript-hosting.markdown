Quite recently I’ve started to use [github](https://github.com/) as a free hosting service for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The way to do this is by using [github pages](http://pages.github.com/). Normally this service is intended to show more information about your project. A bit like an extended readme file. What I’m doing is (ab)using the service for personal use.

### Advantages

It’s free
You’re site is versioned. This means that you can always revert to previous versions and correct mistakes.
It’s open-source. People can fork your code and start doing some awesome things with it themselves.

### My sites

Currently I’ve uploaded all [the examples](http://christianv.github.com/everythingatonce/) for my [Everything At Once](/loading-everything-at-once-javascript-html-css) blogpost. Apart from that I’m also working on a site to show [the latest weather information](http://christianv.github.com/weathery/) in Oostduinkerke, my sailing place in Belgium.
