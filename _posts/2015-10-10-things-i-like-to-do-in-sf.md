Living in the bay area is amazing and these are a couple of awesome things that you can do & places you can go in the city.

### Bike ride to Sausalito or Tiburon & take the ferry back

A low cost activity and will deliver some of the best experiences and views of the city.

Begin with [renting a bike](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ferry-building-bike-rentals-san-francisco) at the Ferry Building after having a [Miette cupcake](https://www.miette.com/locations) or [enjoying some oysters](https://hogislandoysters.com/visit/san-francisco). Along the way you'll pass Fort Mason (definitely check if there are [any events](http://fortmason.org/) going on) and the marina district.

After which you'll bike over the famous Golden Gate and make your way to Sausalito or Tiburon. In Sausalito, [Bar Bocce](http://www.barbocce.com/#bocce) is a great pizza place (recommend the speck) and they have a beach attached. While you're waiting for your pizza, go ahead and play some [Bocce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocce). If you're more adventurous & fit, make it to [Sam's](http://www.samscafe.com/) to Tiburon and try to get a table outside. Start of with a Bloody Mary and then order a Dungeness crab salad and the linguini with Manilla clams. Yum!

At the end of this great experience, slowly make your way back to city by [ferry](http://sanfranciscobayferry.com/node/54).

### Cocktail bars

SF has a couple of hidden gems that I would highly recommend. The first one would be [Wilson & Wilson](http://www.thewilsonbar.com/), where you can't go wrong with the cocktail flight. Another one would be [Local Edition](http://localeditionsf.com/), right on market street. Both places are a bit hidden and with W & W, you even need a password to get in.

Although I'm not the biggest fan of their cocktails, I do recommend [The View](http://www.sfviewlounge.com/restaurant/hotels/hotel-information/travel/sfodt-view-san-francisco-marriott-marquis/) at night, mostly because it has an amazing ... view.

### Some other things...

* Get some cheese & charcuterie and head over to [Dolores Park](http://sfrecpark.org/destination/mission-dolores-park/)
* Go to a [Giants game](http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=sf)
* Ride a [cable car](http://www.sfcablecar.com/)
* Visit [Alcatraz Island](http://www.alcatrazislandtickets.com/) and take the audio tour
* Spend the afternoon in the [Golden Gate Park](http://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/golden-gate-park-guide/), relax in the [Japanese Tea Garden](http://sfrecpark.org/destination/golden-gate-park/japanese-tea-garden/) and have a drink at the [Beach Chalet](http://sfrecpark.org/destination/golden-gate-park/beach-chalet/)
* Hike or ride a bike on [Angel Island](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=468)

And for me, nothing beats a sail on the bay.
