What I’m doing is (ab)using the service for personal use.</p>\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It’s free</strong></li>\n<li>You’re site is <strong>versioned</strong>. This means that you can always revert to previous versions and correct mistakes.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s open-source</strong>: People can fork your code and start doing some awesome things with it themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>My sites</h3>\n<p>Currently I’ve uploaded all <a href=\"https://christianvuerings.github.io/everythingatonce/\">the examples</a> for my <a href=\"/loading-everything-at-once-javascript-html-css\">Everything At Once</a> blogpost.
