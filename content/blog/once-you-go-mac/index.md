Have you ever dreamed about a PC that you don't need to shut down. Where you just had to close the lid and when you open it, it only takes about 2 seconds to be ready to use?

For over a year I've been a proud Mac owner and I won't go back to Windows or any other OS soon.

Currently I run Windows XP, Ubuntu and Fedora next to the native Mac OS X snow leopard operating system. All of this is made possible through the use of virtual machines. It also means that I can run them all at the same time.

### Appreciate a Mac

In a nutshell, some of the things you could appreciate when using a Mac:

* No shutdown needed (except when installing major updates).
* Rotating pictures is so easy (and fun). You open them all in them in the Preview application and turn them with a rotate gesture.
* Multiple operating systems on one machine.

### Where Apple could improve

Although Apple tries really hard to make things as easy for the user as they could, but being perfect isn't really possible. Here's a list of things which where hard to do or could be improved:

* Change the default program for a certain extension. If you want to do this for all the files of a specific type, it can be [cumbersome](http://www.ehow.com/how_4493225_change-programs-mac-os-leopard.html).
* Change the default browser. In or to do this, you need to go [through safari](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/722/mac-os-x-change-the-default-web-browser/), which seems a bit weird to me.
* Add more multi touch gestures to iTunes. For instance when you want to go to the first/last songs in the list - a 3 finger up or down sweep.
